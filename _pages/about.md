I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at [Seoul National
University](https://ece.snu.ac.kr). I am a member of Computer Architecture and
Systems Lab (SNU-CompArch), advised by [Prof. Jaewoong
Sim](https://jaewoong.org). My research interests are in GPU microarchitecture
and the architectural support for emerging workloads, particularly graphics
tasks such as neural rendering, in mobile/edge computing platforms. I received
my B.S. degree from [Seoul National University](https://ece.snu.ac.kr) in
electrical engineering (2022).
