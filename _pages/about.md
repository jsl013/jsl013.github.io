I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at [Seoul National
University](https://ece.snu.ac.kr). I am a member of snu-comparch, advised by
[Prof. Jaewoong Sim](https://jaewoong.org). My research interests are in GPU
microarchitecture and the architectural support for emerging workloads,
especially graphics tasks (e.g., neural rendering), in mobile/edge computing
platform. I received my B.S. degree from [Seoul National
University](https://ece.snu.ac.kr) in electrical engineering (2022).
