  title = {GSCore: Efficient Radiance Field Rendering via Architectural Support for 3D Gaussian Splatting},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {This paper presents GSCore, a hardware acceleration unit that efficiently executes the rendering pipeline of 3D Gaussian Splatting with algorithmic optimizations. GSCore builds on the observations from an in-depth analysis of Gaussian-based radiance field rendering to enhance computational efficiency and bring the technique to wide adoption. In doing so, we present several optimization techniques, Gaussian shape-aware intersection test, hierarchical sorting, and subtile skipping, all of which are synergistically integrated with GSCore. We implement the hardware design of GSCore, synthesize it using a commercial 28nm technology, and evaluate the performance across a range of synthetic and real-world scenes with varying image resolutions. Our evaluation results show that GSCore achieves a 15.86Ã— speedup on average over the mobile consumer GPU with a substantially smaller area and lower energy consumption.},

  abstract = {This paper presents NeuRex, an accelerator architecture that efficiently performs the modern neural rendering pipeline with an algorithmic enhancement and supporting hardware. NeuRex leverages the insights from an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art neural scene representation to make the multi-resolution hash encoding, which is the key operational primitive in modern neural renderings, more hardware-friendly and features a specialized hash encoding engine that enables us to effectively perform the primitive and the overall rendering pipeline. We implement and synthesize NeuRex using a commercial 28nm process technology and evaluate two versions of NeuRex (NeuRex-Edge, NeuRex-Server) on a range of scenes with different image resolutions for mobile and high-end computing platforms. Our evaluation shows that NeuRex achieves up to 9.88x and 3.11x speedups against the mobile and high-end consumer GPUs with a substantially small area overhead and lower energy consumption.},
