  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract = {This paper presents NeuRex, an accelerator architecture that efficiently performs the modern neural rendering pipeline with an algorithmic enhancement and supporting hardware. NeuRex leverages the insights from an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art neural scene representation to make the multi-resolution hash encoding, which is the key operational primitive in modern neural renderings, more hardware-friendly and features a specialized hash encoding engine that enables us to effectively perform the primitive and the overall rendering pipeline. We implement and synthesize NeuRex using a commercial 28nm process technology and evaluate two versions of NeuRex (NeuRex-Edge, NeuRex-Server) on a range of scenes with different image resolutions for mobile and high-end computing platforms. Our evaluation shows that NeuRex achieves up to 9.88\texttimes{} and 3.11\texttimes{} speedups against the mobile and high-end consumer GPUs with a substantially small area overhead and lower energy consumption.},
